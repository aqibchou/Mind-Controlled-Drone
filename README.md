# Mind Controlled Drone

A drone system controlled solely through the brain, utilizing machine learning techniques and filtering algorithms to discriminate between motor imagery signals captured using an EEG signal detector.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a drone that can be controlled using only EEG signals. By analyzing motor imagery signals through advanced ML algorithms, the system interprets brain activity patterns to execute flight commands.

## Status

**Work in Progress**

This project is currently under active development. Documentation, code, and resources will be available soon.

## Technology Stack

- Machine Learning for motor imagery signal classification
- Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology
- Motor imagery signal discrimination algorithms
- Much more to be implemented soon
